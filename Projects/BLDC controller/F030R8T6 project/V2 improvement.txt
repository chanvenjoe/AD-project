PCB:
1. 3.3/5V is close to GND, need to handel it in ruls
2. Try to avoid in-pad via to reduce cost
3. Wins is interfered, make it anti-clockwise
4. ESL in source path cause negtive voltage
5. The Wins PWM vias are too close to GND, easily causing the short circuit      +
6. Wins driving circuit ground is not well roughted
7. Reduce the MOS GS circuit loop for smaller ESC/ESR and shorter on/off time
8. Don't pour the ground to all top layer, it can increase the risk of short circuit
9. tear drop after finshing roughting
10. HO1 roughting improvement to shorten the on time

Schenmatic
4. BT/ module TX/RX mixed up and the power should be 3.3V  ¡Ì
5. Download connector should be 3.3V and work with ST LINK JLINK     6. TVCC should connect to PCB's 3,3V          7. Change the flash connector to 6pin
8. MCU 5V is not valid, can connect to 3.3V      ¡Ì
9. Vbat divider change to 6.2K and 43K    ¡Ì
10. Adding resistor bwtween MCU and gate driver   ¡Á
11.Wins gate driving, the resistor of GS should be directly connect to Gate, now it is not   ¡Ì
12. Add USB port for USART and power supply and boost circuit to charge Battery£¨(think about the circuit when charging and powering the PCB)  X
13. Need diode to MOS driver for Cb charging      X£¨ The closing is pretty fast )
14.IR2106 need 10V as minimum VCC, change to new one(Using Transistor?)    EG2104 doesn't have UVP  X
15. MPU and BT should use differenct IO port     ¡Ì
16£¬ Need to avoid negative voltage from BEMF circuit by change the ground to a certaint voltage? ¡Ì      adding zenor diode
17. Add a electronic power switch     X
18. IR2106 can UVP is 9V, should change to another one  X
19.Cb should be big enough for lower swithing frequency(10 uf for exmple)   ¡Ì
20. Schematic RX TX should not be the same as BT module¡Ì         ¡Ì
21. Voltage bat divider factor is too small(change to   43 6.2K) ¡Ì
22. Add diode to the LDO to prevent reverse voltage       ¡Ì
23. The voltage divider resistance too big will lead to unstable ADC samplling      X
24.Add 100ohm resistor between MCU and gate driver      X
25.Prevent the reverse voltage when using the STlink as power source  ¡Ì
26. Add air pressure sensor to circuit         ¡Ì
