PCB:
1. The via should not be in the pad or you don't know whether it is connected(Like the CAP GND)
2. C8 is not connected to the greater ground

Schenmatic
1. switch the TX/RX posisstion for better connection
2. Preserve the SPI hardwar funtions
3. Preserve the UART2 port with USB plug for both communication and Power supply
4. Add a zenner diode to decrease voltage to 5V to keep LDO temperature down
5. Using low voltage operation gate driver
