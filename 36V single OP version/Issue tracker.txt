1. Hall have paulse(high) in RF-36 not in 1702
2.Add diode the gate for Cgs discharging
3.LM358 positive feedback（wrong）
4. Motor PIN connector
5.Charging diode position
6.Cap must be there or Motor will burn the DCDC 
7.Transistor pull up/down resistor(or gate resistor) consideration
8.Schenmatic  COMP should be 68pf
9.Add resistor to each power port
10.Gate resistor change to 4.7ohm


Layout:
1. Fuse
2. Heatsink position
3. Relay position
4. Sampling resistor size
5.Open window can't not open two wires
6.Power and ground should have distance
7. Mos Gate driver ground connection
8.MCU ground connection
9.The layout should be sorted by IC or components(as groups)
