1. Hall have paulse(high) in RF-36 not in 1702
2.Add diode the gate for Cgs discharging
3.LM358 positive input
4. Motor PIN connector
5.Charging diode position
6.Cap must be there or Motor will burn the DCDC
7.Transistor pull up/down resistor(or gate resistor) consideration
8.Schenmatic  COMP should be 68pf
9.Add resistor to each power port
10.Gate resistor change to 4.7ohm
11.Not positive feedback (OPA)
12.OPA out put cap value is TBD


Layout:
1. Fuse
2. Heatsink position ,heatsink's Pin is not correct
3. Relay position
4. Sampling resistor size The fuse footprint
5.Open window can't not open two wires
6.Power and ground should have distance
7. Mos Gate driver ground connection
8.Ground is not completed, some are not connected
9.Power grid is too long
10.MCU ground connection
11.The layout should be sorted by IC or components(as groups)
12.7550 footprint
13.The 7805 footprint?
14.The heatsink position is kind of overlaped, and for better installation, the lower bridge should be opposite
15.Remove dead copper

Program:
1. No dead time cause the up/low side MOS open at the same time




V2 issue tracker
1. The motor connector size is not right
2.the footprint of diodes is too small DCDC, relay driver Mos discharge
