Good xxx everyone, I'm Kevin of the PD team
This has been the sixth month from the day i became a 	Flyer!(picture)
Yeah, eversince the company meeting, anything related to Flyer, this magic piture and sound followed

Alright!
During these time, Lots of things happened
So in this occation, I want you to follow up with this mileston and Let's start from the day 28th March


3. Getting acquainted with every one is always the first step
Danfeng took me to meet everyone in the office , (but frankly , i forgot next minute.) 
Next day i meet someone in the elevator she said goodmorning kevin, "Yeah good morning to you too, i remenber you ,you are
at the connor in front of that window. (It was really awkward since i could read from her face "What's my name)
Remembering a person usually with a special event, it is(danmu), those trainings and mettings, So I know all of you in a week
First week of FLYER,So far so good



4.First meeting with AC team
1. That is the first time i talk to US office, they introduce these products, So many strange words and project code
 but thank god, Dan speaks slowly, which gave me a break.
At first i thought "wow, interesting, so many great products"
But a month later, i can't laugh anymore. The 942 FS

5.
There were tons of problems, press the pedal, protection, carefully press the pedal and drive  for 5 meters, protection
Drifting, incline, grass ect... protection. So we tried to find out why, we record tones of current data and show them to GB
But they just keep complaining and didn't want to explain why, at the same time we have tried different conbinations of motor and ratio of gear box so there
are hundreds of document in the foler, in the mean time, the other projects, I almost got crazy.

6.
So when i back to the office Marshell and i had conversation, which save me from the negative. 2 key points

1. Always set a priority, irrigating the most fertile land you can get more fruit, while if wast the water on the dry land is
wast of resource, So I use this four quadren principle to clear the huge mess, So i got this
Which allows me to focus on the main problem and be concentrated

2.It is the emotion that affects you, not people, not things.  Somehow i was enlightened
I looked at the wall where the FLYER codes and Mission at
Yes right! If i'm the kid with 942, i'll be totally disappointed by it. What i wanna see the smiles and thrills on their face while driving 942
Yes I can, I can solve these problems, I want it be to a gift that every chidren will be crazy about

7.We have our own techneque, our own solution for rid-on, luminous and sound solution
The factory can do ODM, or OEM for us. If we don't know it is feasible with current techknoledge, how can we make everything possible


8-9
Before going home, I went to drive the 942 in the lab, that is a great place for drifting(since the cost issue, more time spent on solving problems)
I don't want any kid who have this as present feeling sad if the cart malfunction, I want see smiles on their face, making sure of that
they are exciting when receiving and driving 942

future: #942


So much wonderful and great things hapened
First volmite, First time travle to other city for business, I realy enjoy the trip, especially the sunrize the night scene, which took away
all the drowsiness and fatigue(Pictures in the flight)

People hardly understand what it means to one who felt this could happen only in dreams
