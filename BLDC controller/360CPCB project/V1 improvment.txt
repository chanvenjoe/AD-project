1. 3.3V LDO part adj connection wrong
2. Silk prints invissible
3. Conponent too close lead to hard wire roughting
4. Power and ground pins should be Seperated (motor wire for example)
5. Change to download connector to 6pin 2.54
6. the crosse zero detection circuit can it be bigger than 5v?  10.Maybe adding clamping to the BEMF detection circuit
7. adding test point for MCU ports
8. Adding charge IC(3s) to the schematic
9. The bias for opa seems usless in this circuit
10.Change Bat and Motor connector
11.Diode for Wins' motor
12.Mark GND   VCC to footprint
13. The J-TAG GND work from 4th one
14. Change the MCU to mm32spin27ps for better soldering
15.PCB layout when putting compoennts, vcc and gnd should be seperated
